                  , I&apos;m fascinated by the power of computer programming to bring mathematical concepts to life. 
                  I&apos;ve always been passionate about creation and development, and I relish the opportunity to explore the potential of the technologies at my disposal.

                  In my free time, I enjoy playing board and video games as well as many rec sports (rock climbing, snowboarding, volleyball, & pickleball are my favorites).
                  I also enjoy origami, learning new technologies, and binge-watching series. <br /><br />
